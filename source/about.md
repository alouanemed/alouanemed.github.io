This is for now an empty blog.let's hope I am gonna share my thoughts and stuff in here sooner
spend most of my time trying to kill those bugs first every time I wrote a line of code, while trying to figure out how to be fully ready for the zombie apocalypse.

Have no idea what I am doing in this life,but I am full ready for the Apocalypse.

Looking for a challenging job to funnel my coding skills to build awesome IT solutions, that can make life much easier for people in their daily life.
